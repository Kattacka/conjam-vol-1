[h2] 9 New Items! [/h2]
ModJam was a contest hosted by me, ConBoi, to challenge people to make a singular new item over the course of a week. I was able to get 9 submissions by the following talented people:

Glitched Miner - Monwil
Mega Dice - Foks
Holy Hamsa - Stale
Floast Hat - Kerkel, Split
Strange Mask - Spoop
Hexagonal Core - Aeronaut, Truji
Bucket Of Boots - 4Head, Skulldier
Dad's Savings - Kattack, Chuz
Hornpipe - John Sorrow

Special thanks to Kerkel for compiling all of the mods into one big modpack.</description>
